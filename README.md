## SVG-Talk

- Introduction and to introduce the working area, namely:
  - Browser Viewport
  - SVG Viewport
  - Viewbox and coordinate system
- When to use and when not to use D3
- How to make SVGs responsive and scale to devices of different sizes
- Performance.  How to track down performance problems.  I could really do with the logrocket license for this
- I'd like to show how SVGs are not the ideal solution for large datasets and WEBGL is a better choice
